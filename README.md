## Game Design Document

The project also has a **Game Design Document**. This document includes the 
entire plan for the game and a lot more potential additions that we did not have
time to include.

[Game Design Document](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/wiki/Design-Document)
can be found from the repo's wiki.


## Builds and Videos

### Prototype

The prototype build was created on 20.11. This means that it was done in the
first week of the project. The build for it can be found at the v0.0.1 tag on 
the Releases page.

[v0.0.1 | Releases](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

### Beta version

The beta version was 2 weeks after the prototype. There were already a lot more
highly important building blocks for the game ready by then. It was still crude
and difficult to handle the car though. This build would then be later used for
playtesting in front of the course participants.

The playtesting notes can be found at [the Playtesting page of the wiki](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/wiki/Playtesting)

[v0.1.2 | Releases](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/releases/tag/v0.1.2)


### Game project release

The final version for the game project course would be version 1.0.0. This was
built on 17.12. It includes a lot more features, bugfixes and thematic improvements.
We added the final bug fixes very late in the night, so that we would ensure the
presentation at school to work smoothly.

The school presentation included students from the traffic engineering part of
HAMK Riihim√§ki. Because of that we were able to get some nice and diverse feedback
for our game. The feedback gathered from the day are scanned and documented in
this repository.

[School presentation reviews](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/wiki/Final-version-reviews)

For now this will be the last version of the game we will develop. But the game
still has lots of potential with already planned features and ideas.

We believe that given more time with the project, the game could become a
success, due to it's fun gameplay and theming.

## Other course material

### Script showcase

As part of the module's Game Programming course. We had to create a video that
showcased a script that we enjoyed particularily and one that we thought the
other students might learn something from.

[Script Showcase - Delivery Trail](https://youtu.be/9b1-6uZI4ZA)

<details>
  <summary><b>üè´&nbsp;The Assigment - Game programming assignment #3</b></summary>
    <p>
        Your task is to present a script snippet that you developed during the
        course. Pick a script you find the most interesting or that you‚Äôre proud
        of. The idea is to share different solutions to different problems with
        your classmates and to show off your problem-solving skills and ‚Äúcode-
        creativity‚Äù prowess. :D
    </p>
    <p>
        What do? As a group, create a short video explaining your script. 
        It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy, just make sure it‚Äôs clear and 
        informative!
    </p>
    <p>
        Video should loosely cover following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>What the script does</strong>: Explain problem this script 
            fixes or the purpose it serves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How you made it</strong>: Walk us through the key parts
            of the script
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>: Talk about any difficulties you ran 
            into and how you handled those.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Scalability</strong>: Is this scalable or reusable script 
            as is? 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>: If you had more time, what would you 
            change?
        </li>
    </ul>

  <summary><b>üì£&nbsp;The Assigment - Level Design for Mega Man Maker</b></summary>
    <p>
        In this assignment you will practice both level design skills and play
        testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The target is a free PC game called Mega Man Maker. It allows to create
        levels for Mega Man series. The editor is very easy to use, but has one
        caveat. To exit your level, you should have bound a key to pause the 
        level (I use P button for this), then use arrow keys and Z button to 
        select exit and then mouse to select confirm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to make together a game level, which consists of 6 to 12
        screens, has at least 2 different enemies and the final screen of the 
        level must feature one relatively easy boss. If you use any special 
        mechanics or require player to use them to advance, teach those 
        mechanics first. You can only assume that the player first knows how to
        move to basic directions, jump, shoot and change weapon. In other words
        you should not assume that the player knows sliding or double jump.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to aim for a level, which is fun for the player, rewarding for the 
        player. The end result should also be audio visually good e.g. music 
        and background both suit the level.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The difficulty level of the level should be easy</strong>. In 
        other words, pretty much anybody should be able to pass it in 1-2
        attempts in a duration of maximum of 5 minutes. You can fail the 
        difficulty level easily by having more than 2 enemies in one screen,
        requiring the player to do difficult jumps or jump and shoot same time,
        setting up a boss, which is hard to defeat.
    </p>
