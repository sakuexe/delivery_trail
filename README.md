## Builds and Videos


### Prototype

The prototype build was created on 20.11. This means that it was done in the
first week of the project. The build for it can be found at the v0.0.1 tag on 
the Releases page.

[v0.0.1 | Releases](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

### Beta version

The beta version was 2 weeks after the prototype. There were already a lot more
highly important building blocks for the game ready by then. It was still crude
and difficult to handle the car though. This build would then be later used for
playtesting in front of the course participants.

The playtesting notes can be found at [the Playtesting page of the wiki](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/wiki/Playtesting)

[v0.1.2 | Releases](https://github.com/sakuexe/delivery_trail/releases/tag/v0.1.2)


### Game project release

The final version for the game project course would be version 1.0.0. This was
built on 17.12. It includes a lot more features, bugfixes and thematic improvements.
We added the final bug fixes very late in the night, so that we would ensure the
presentation at school to work smoothly.

The school presentation included students from the traffic engineering part of
HAMK Riihim√§ki. Because of that we were able to get some nice and diverse feedback
for our game. The feedback gathered from the day are scanned and documented in
this repository.

For now this will be the last version of the game we will develop. But never say
never with these things.

> Remember to add the images actually and don't just forget to do it ffs.

## Other material

### Script showcase

As part of the module's Game Programming course. We had to create a video that
showcased a script that we enjoyed particularily and one that we thought the
other students might learn something from.

[Script Showcase - Delivery Trail](https://youtu.be/9b1-6uZI4ZA)

<details>
  <summary><b>üè´&nbsp;The Assigment - Game programming assignment #3</b></summary>
    <p>
        Your task is to present a script snippet that you developed during the
        course. Pick a script you find the most interesting or that you‚Äôre proud
        of. The idea is to share different solutions to different problems with
        your classmates and to show off your problem-solving skills and ‚Äúcode-
        creativity‚Äù prowess. :D
    </p>
    <p>
        What do? As a group, create a short video explaining your script. 
        It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy, just make sure it‚Äôs clear and 
        informative!
    </p>
    <p>
        Video should loosely cover following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>What the script does</strong>: Explain problem this script 
            fixes or the purpose it serves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How you made it</strong>: Walk us through the key parts
            of the script
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>: Talk about any difficulties you ran 
            into and how you handled those.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Scalability</strong>: Is this scalable or reusable script 
            as is? 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>: If you had more time, what would you 
            change?
        </li>
    </ul>
