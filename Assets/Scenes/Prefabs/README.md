# Prefabs

Here you can place all of the objects that you have created and would like to 
reuse in different scenes. They also work well if you want to programatically
add them to the same scene.

A good example for using a prefab is with the main player's car. Since it 
includes lots of components and objects within it. Using prefabs, you can always
just drag and drop the player car to your scenes.

Another example would be with assets that are reused in different places. 
Especially if they have things like custom hitboxes and objects within them.
