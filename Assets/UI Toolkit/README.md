# User Interface

For most of the user interface needs, we should use Unity's UI toolkit. It is 
quite new and allows for responsive and flexible UIs to be built a bit easier.

If the UI toolkit turns out to be shit, then we can switch it out to something
else instead. But the UI working on all screens is a priority, so it should be
at least tested out.
