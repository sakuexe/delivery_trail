# Inputs and Unity's Input Manager

Here you can place all of the input maps that you might want to create. The main
input system that we use in the game is Unity's Input Manager system.

Input Manager allows us to refer to actions with their action names inside the 
code, instead of hardcoding the keys right in. This way we can add more controller
support in the future if we so desire, without changing the code.
